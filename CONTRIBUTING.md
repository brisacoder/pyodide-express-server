# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving the Pyodide Express Server! All types of contributions are welcome.

## Getting Started
1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. Install Node.js (v16 or later) and npm (v8 or later).
3. Run `npm ci` to install dependencies.
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust values as needed.
5. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.

## Development Workflow
- Use `npm run lint` to lint the code and `npm run format` to apply formatting.
- Run `npm test` to execute the test suite. Some tests expect the server to be running locally on port 3000.
- Add or update tests alongside code changes when possible.
- Commit with clear messages and open a pull request describing your changes.

## Reporting Issues
Please open an issue if you find a bug or have a feature request. Include as much detail as possible to help us reproduce and fix the problem.
