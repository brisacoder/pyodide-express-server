# Memory Leak Fix Summary

## Problem
The Pyodide process pool was consuming all 32GB of system memory after running ~200 pytest tests, causing system crashes. The root cause was that Python objects and variables created during code execution were never being cleaned up, leading to massive memory accumulation.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Automatic Memory Cleanup After Each Execution
Added `cleanupPythonMemory()` function in `src/services/pyodide-executor.js` that:
- Clears all user-created global variables after each code execution
- Removes non-essential modules from sys.modules
- Forces Python garbage collection
- Automatically called after every code execution (success or failure)

### 2. Reduced Process Recycling Threshold
Changed `maxExecutions` in `src/services/pyodide-process-pool.js`:
- From: 100 executions before recycling
- To: 20 executions before recycling
- This ensures processes are recycled more frequently to prevent memory buildup

### 3. Added Memory Monitoring
Implemented memory tracking in the process pool:
- `getMemoryUsage()` method tracks memory statistics
- `startMemoryMonitoring()` runs every 30 seconds
- Logs warnings when memory exceeds 500MB
- Forces cleanup when memory exceeds 2GB
- Helps identify future memory issues early

### 4. Memory Cleanup Handler
Added 'cleanup' message handler in the executor to allow forced memory cleanup when needed.

## Key Code Changes

### pyodide-executor.js
```javascript
async function cleanupPythonMemory() {
  // Clears user globals, removes modules, forces GC
  // Called automatically after each execution
}
```

### pyodide-process-pool.js
```javascript
// Reduced threshold
this.maxExecutions = options.maxExecutions || 20;

// Memory monitoring
startMemoryMonitoring() {
  // Monitors and logs memory usage
  // Forces cleanup if memory gets too high
}
```

## Testing
Created comprehensive memory cleanup tests in `tests/test_memory_cleanup.py`:
- Verifies memory is cleaned after single execution
- Tests multiple executions don't accumulate memory
- Ensures global variables are cleaned between executions
- Stress tests with 20 executions to confirm no leaks

## Result
Memory is now automatically cleaned after each code execution, preventing the catastrophic memory buildup that was causing system crashes during test runs.
