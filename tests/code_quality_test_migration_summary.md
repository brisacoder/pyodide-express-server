# Code Quality Test Migration Summary

## Changes Completed

### 1. ✅ Converted to Pytest
- Replaced `unittest.TestCase` classes with pytest-style test classes
- Changed all `self.assertEqual()`, `self.assertGreater()`, etc. to pytest `assert` statements
- Removed inheritance from `unittest.TestCase`
- Added `pytest` import and removed `unittest` import
- Changed `self.skipTest()` to `pytest.skip()`
- Changed `self.fail()` to `pytest.fail()`

### 2. ✅ Global Constants Defined
- `PROJECT_ROOT` - Path to project root directory
- `NODE_MODULES_BIN` - Path to node_modules/.bin directory
- `MAX_FORMATTING_ISSUES = 20` - Maximum allowed formatting issues
- `MIN_JSDOC_COVERAGE = 0.5` - Minimum JSDoc documentation coverage (50%)
- `STANDARD_LIBS` - List of Python standard library modules
- `THIRD_PARTY_LIBS` - List of third-party library modules

### 3. ✅ No Internal REST APIs Used
- The tests only analyze code files and run linters
- No REST API calls are made at all
- No endpoints with 'pyodide' in them are used

### 4. ✅ BDD Style Implementation
- Each test follows Given-When-Then pattern
- Test names clearly describe the scenario: `test_when_X_then_Y`
- Added descriptive docstrings with explicit Given/When/Then sections
- Organized tests into logical classes:
  - `TestJavaScriptCodeQuality` - JavaScript linting and standards
  - `TestPythonCodeQuality` - Python linting and standards

## Test Coverage

The refactored tests cover:
- **JavaScript Quality**:
  - ESLint compliance (no errors allowed)
  - JSDoc documentation coverage (minimum 50%)
  - Code formatting consistency (indentation, trailing whitespace)
- **Python Quality**:
  - Flake8 compliance (no issues allowed)
  - PEP 8 import organization (standard → third_party → local)
  - Unused import detection (informational only)

## BDD Test Examples

### JavaScript ESLint Test
```python
def test_when_running_eslint_then_no_errors_found(self):
    """
    Given: JavaScript source files in the project
    When: ESLint is run on the source directory
    Then: Should find no ESLint errors
    """
```

### Python Import Order Test
```python
def test_when_checking_import_order_then_follows_pep8_organization(self):
    """
    Given: Python test files with imports
    When: Checking import organization
    Then: Should follow PEP 8 order (standard -> third_party -> local)
    """
```

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all code quality tests
uv run pytest tests/test_code_quality_compliance.py -v

# Run only JavaScript quality tests
uv run pytest tests/test_code_quality_compliance.py::TestJavaScriptCodeQuality -v

# Run only Python quality tests
uv run pytest tests/test_code_quality_compliance.py::TestPythonCodeQuality -v
```

## Test Results

The tests are working correctly. The ESLint test is currently failing because there are actual ESLint errors in the codebase:
- 3 errors found in JavaScript files
- 2 warnings found in JavaScript files

This indicates the test is functioning properly by detecting code quality issues.
