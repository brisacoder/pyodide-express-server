# Performance Test Refactoring Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the complete refactoring of `test_performance.py` from unittest to pytest with BDD-style testing according to the specified requirements.

## Requirements Fulfilled ✅

### 1. Convert to Pytest ✅
- **Before**: Used `unittest.TestCase` with `setUp`, `tearDown`, and `assertXX` methods
- **After**: Uses pytest with class-based tests, fixtures, and `assert` statements
- **Impact**: Modern pytest syntax with better error reporting and fixture management

### 2. Global Configuration ✅
- **Before**: Hardcoded values like `BASE_URL = "http://localhost:3000"` and timeouts
- **After**: Centralized global constants:
  ```python
  BASE_URL = "http://localhost:3000"
  DEFAULT_TIMEOUT = 30  # seconds
  UPLOAD_TIMEOUT = 60   # seconds for file uploads
  EXECUTION_TIMEOUT = 30000  # milliseconds for Pyodide execution
  MAX_RETRIES = 3
  ```

### 3. Removed Internal REST APIs ✅
- **Before**: Used internal APIs with 'pyodide' in the name:
  - `/api/pyodide-files/` (lines 201, 239, 262, 342)
  - `/api/upload-csv` (multiple locations)
- **After**: Only uses public APIs:
  - `/api/uploaded-files` for file management
  - `/api/upload` for file uploads
  - `/health` for health checks

### 4. BDD Style Implementation ✅
- **Before**: Traditional test method names like `test_execution_timeout()`
- **After**: BDD-style with Given-When-Then structure:
  ```python
  def test_execution_timeout_handling(self, server_session: requests.Session) -> None:
      """
      Test that long-running code is properly timed out.
      
      Given a Pyodide server is running
      When I submit long-running Python code with a short timeout
      Then the execution should complete within reasonable time
      And not exceed the system timeout limits
      """
      # Given: Long-running Python code
      long_running_code = '''...'''
      
      # When: Execute with short timeout
      response = server_session.post(...)
      
      # Then: Should complete within reasonable time
      assert execution_time < 10, f"Execution took too long: {execution_time}s"
  ```

### 5. Only Use /api/execute-raw ✅
- **Before**: Used `/api/execute` with JSON payloads
- **After**: Exclusively uses `/api/execute-raw` with raw text payloads:
  ```python
  response = server_session.post(
      f"{BASE_URL}/api/execute-raw",
      data=python_code,
      headers={"Content-Type": "text/plain"},
      timeout=DEFAULT_TIMEOUT
  )
  ```

### 6. No Internal REST APIs ✅
- **Before**: Used APIs like `/api/pyodide-files/`, `/api/file-info/`
- **After**: Only uses documented public APIs from the server

### 7. Comprehensive Coverage ✅
- **Test Categories**:
  - **Execution Performance**: timeout handling, memory-intensive operations, CPU-intensive calculations
  - **File Processing Performance**: large CSV processing, multiple file operations
  - **Concurrent Request Performance**: multiple simultaneous requests
  - **Resource Cleanup Performance**: error handling and resource management
  - **Performance Benchmarks**: execution time consistency, memory usage stability

### 8. Full Docstrings ✅
- **Before**: Minimal or missing docstrings
- **After**: Comprehensive docstrings for:
  - Module-level documentation
  - All test classes
  - All test methods with Given-When-Then structure
  - All pytest fixtures

## Technical Improvements

### Pytest Fixtures
```python
@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def server_session() -> Generator[requests.Session, None, None]:
    """Provide a reusable HTTP session for all tests."""

@pytest.fixture
def uploaded_files_tracker() -> Generator[List[str], None, None]:
    """Track uploaded files for automatic cleanup after each test."""

@pytest.fixture  
def temp_files_tracker() -> Generator[List[Path], None, None]:
    """Track temporary files for automatic cleanup after each test."""
```

### BDD Structure Example
```python
def test_large_csv_processing(
    self, 
    server_session: requests.Session,
    uploaded_files_tracker: List[str],
    temp_files_tracker: List[Path]
) -> None:
    """
    Test processing of larger CSV files.
    
    Given a large CSV file is created
    When I upload and process the file through the API
    Then the upload and processing should complete within time limits
    And return correct analysis results
    """
```

### Modern Python Patterns
- Type hints for all function parameters and return values
- `pathlib.Path` for file operations
- Context managers for proper resource handling
- List comprehensions and generator expressions

## Test Organization

### Class Structure
1. **TestExecutionPerformance**: Core Python execution testing
2. **TestFileProcessingPerformance**: File upload and processing
3. **TestConcurrentRequestPerformance**: Multiple request handling
4. **TestResourceCleanupPerformance**: Error recovery and cleanup
5. **TestPerformanceBenchmarks**: Additional performance validation

### Coverage Areas
- ✅ Timeout handling
- ✅ Memory-intensive operations  
- ✅ CPU-intensive calculations
- ✅ Large file processing (5000 row CSV)
- ✅ Multiple file operations
- ✅ Concurrent request handling
- ✅ Error recovery and cleanup
- ✅ Performance consistency
- ✅ Memory usage stability

## Migration Notes

### API Changes
- **Old**: `POST /api/execute` with `{"code": "...", "timeout": 5000}`
- **New**: `POST /api/execute-raw` with raw text body

### File Operations
- **Old**: Used internal `/api/pyodide-files/` endpoints
- **New**: Uses public `/api/upload` and `/api/uploaded-files` endpoints

### Server Management
- **Old**: Started server as subprocess in test setup
- **New**: Assumes server is already running, uses session fixture for health checks
