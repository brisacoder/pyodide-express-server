# Plots Directory

This directory contains plots generated by the matplotlib and seaborn test suites.

## Structure

- `matplotlib/` - Contains plots generated by the matplotlib tests
- `seaborn/` - Contains plots generated by the seaborn tests

## Purpose

These plots are generated during testing to verify that:

1. The Pyodide environment can successfully execute plotting code
2. Plot data can be generated and processed within Pyodide
3. Plots can be exported as base64-encoded images and saved to the local filesystem
4. **NEW**: Plots can be saved directly from within Pyodide to the local filesystem using Node.js filesystem mounting

## Test Types

The test suites include two types of plot generation:

### Base64 Transfer Tests

- Generate plots in Pyodide
- Convert to base64 encoding
- Transfer via HTTP response
- Decode and save on the server side

### Direct Filesystem Save Tests

- Mount local directories into Pyodide's virtual filesystem
- Generate plots in Pyodide
- Save directly to mounted local filesystem paths
- Verify file creation and integrity

## Generated Files

The test suites will create various PNG files in their respective directories:

### Matplotlib Tests

- `basic_line_plot.png` - Simple sine wave line plot (base64 transfer)
- `scatter_plot_colors.png` - Colored scatter plot with varying sizes (base64 transfer)
- `histogram_plot.png` - Dual histogram comparison (base64 transfer)
- `subplot_complex.png` - Complex subplot layout with multiple functions (base64 transfer)
- `direct_save_basic.png` - Trigonometric functions saved directly from Pyodide
- `direct_save_complex.png` - Multi-subplot dashboard saved directly from Pyodide

### Seaborn Tests

- `regression_plot.png` - Linear regression plot with confidence intervals (base64 transfer)
- `distribution_plots.png` - Multiple distribution visualizations (base64 transfer)
- `correlation_heatmap.png` - Correlation matrix heatmap (base64 transfer)
- `pair_plot.png` - Pair plot with grouped data (base64 transfer)
- `direct_save_regression.png` - Regression analysis saved directly from Pyodide
- `direct_save_dashboard.png` - Comprehensive analytics dashboard saved directly from Pyodide

## Note

These files are regenerated each time the tests run, so they represent the latest test execution results. The test suites automatically clean up any existing plot files before generating new ones to ensure fresh results.
